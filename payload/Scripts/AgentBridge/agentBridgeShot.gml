// without running a single step event, so the game does not advance.

// agentBridgeHudVisible(false) to leave the HUD out of a screenshot, and reactivates
// them right along with everything else. So that suppression has to be re-applied here,
// every single shot, immediately before the redraw it would otherwise survive past for
// exactly one frame - long enough to appear in the very screenshot it was meant to be
// hidden from.

// gm8directbuild.js - build a GM8 project into an exe with no GUI at all.
//
// Game Maker 8 has no command-line compile: the IDE is the only thing that can
// produce an executable, so every published build process for a GM8 project -
// including the game's own build.bat - stops at a person choosing File > Create
// Executable. This closes that gap without a person and without a visible
// desktop: it launches Game Maker attached to a throwaway desktop that is never
// displayed anywhere, injects a small DLL that calls straight into the compiled
// routine behind that menu item (skipping the menu, and the Save dialog with
// it), and tears the whole thing down again. See gm8directbuild/build.c
// for how that routine was found and what it does.
//
// Game Maker does not need to be told its window is hidden - CreateDesktop
// gives it a real desktop object with a real window station, so it starts up
// exactly as it would on the interactive one (its own IsWindowVisible even
// reports true). It just never gets composited to a monitor, because nothing
// ever makes that desktop the active one. This is why the win32.windows() /
// hasMenu() readiness check below works completely unchanged: the calling
// thread switches its own desktop with SetThreadDesktop, and FindWindowExW -
// which enumerates whatever desktop the calling thread is currently on -
// simply follows it there.
//
// The desktop is doing more than hiding the main window, which is why it is
// worth its ~20 lines rather than patching the executable to start invisible
// (which is possible - Game_Maker.exe is XtreamLok-wrapped, but the wrapper
// turns out not to checksum .text, measured 2026-08-21). Everything that
// actually threatens an unattended build is a *separate* window: a Delphi
// TErrorForm, a DFM streaming failure at startup, a message box from inside
// the build path. None of those care whether the main form is visible, and on
// a real desktop they would land in front of whoever is using the machine,
// take focus, and block the injected thread until it times out. A desktop
// nobody is looking at contains all of them for free.
//
// ⚠️ SetThreadDesktop is not free to leave behind: while this thread is on the
// hidden desktop it can see no other window on the machine, CloseDesktop
// refuses (ERROR_BUSY) while any thread is still assigned to it, and there is
// no "back to where I came from" unless the original handle was kept. Measured:
// 45 top-level windows visible, 0 after switching, 0 still after a CloseDesktop
// that returned false, 45 again only after switching back. So the original
// desktop is saved before the switch and restored in the finally, ahead of
// CloseDesktop - otherwise every later win32 window enumeration in this Node
// process (the runner and launcher.js both do plenty) would quietly find
// nothing at all.
//
// Because it calls a hardcoded address, this only works against the one
// exact Game_Maker.exe build it was reverse-engineered against (sha256
// below) - a different build, even a same-version recompile, would have
// that address mean something else entirely. It refuses to run against
// anything else rather than guess.
//
// Usage:
//   node lib/gm8directbuild.js <project.gmk> <output.exe> [options]
//
// Exit codes: 0 = the executable was produced, 1 = it was not.

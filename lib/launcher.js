// launcher.js - launch Gang Garrison 2 with the agent bridge enabled, and keep
// it running unattended.
//
// GM8 answers three ordinary situations with a modal dialog: no audio device,
// which happens routinely over RDP; any GML runtime error; and every call to
// show_message, which is how the game's own unit tests report. All of them
// freeze the game before or after the bridge starts listening, and take every
// pending bridge call down with them. Nothing inside the game can clear its own
// modal, so this process stays resident and clicks the boxes away from outside,
// writing down what they said on the way past.
//
// It owns the game as a child process, so it knows the pid without searching,
// exits when the game does, and can keep the instance register honest.
//
// On Linux the game runs under Wine, where only a Windows program can see its
// dialogs. There the child is linux/gamewatch.exe, which starts the game, does
// the clicking, and prints what it saw in this log's own format; this process
// only timestamps its lines. gamewatch holds the game in a job object that
// dies with it, so the child's pid still stops the game.
//
// Usage:
//   node launcher.js <path to game exe> [--name <label>] [--role <role>]
//                    [extra game args]
//
// Exit codes: 0 = game ran and exited, 1 = could not start it.

// offers Abort and Ignore, so a launcher that clicks the first button it finds
// kills the game. Press Ignore by name, and read the error out of it first -
// that text is usually the only explanation the runner will get for a call that
// suddenly started timing out.
//
// The other two carry show_message, which is how the game's assertion helpers
// report; the test runner reads its results back out of this log. The two kinds
// are marked differently, because a failed assertion is not a crash and must
// not be reported as one.
//
// These forms all exist from startup and are merely hidden, so only visible
// ones count - otherwise this would sit clicking buttons on invisible windows.
